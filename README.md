## Overview

This web application is designed to automate the process of filling two specific IWBF player assessment forms: `Worksheet-Stages-2C-and-3.pdf` and `Assessment-Form-Stages-2AB.pdf`. It uses data from an Excel spreadsheet (`Players.xlsx`) to quickly generate multiple personalized PDF forms.

This tool streamlines the manual form-filling process, making it efficient for professionals involved in player assessment.
